#Discipline

Using `launchd`, Applescript and SelfControl, three daemons will force me to keep a productive schedule.

1) Block sites from 1.00 to 7.00 (go to sleep)
2) Block sites from 9.00 to 13.00 (morning work)
3) Block sites from 14.00 to 18.00 (afternoon work)

Also:

* start even if in sleep
* notify 5 minutes before starting
* on 2) and 3), launch Pomodoro
